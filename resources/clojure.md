> "Clojure is a language written by production developers, for production developers writing business systems" -- Stu Halloway

Clojure and ClojureScript offer substantial improvements in software development while retaining investment in today's existing installed computing platforms, specifically the Java Virtual Machine and the web browser.

Rather than offer developers a multitude of language 'features', Clojure reduces the available options to those that will result in _reliable software systems_.

It is a key observation of Clojure's designers that _unreliable software arises from the extent to which a system's internal state changes are allowed to happen_. The result is unmanageable complexity, keeping software development and maintenance costs high and preventing gains from  parallelism.

Clojure reflects a revolution in the way that software developers manage an application's most important asset: it's data. And Clojure's benefits are available to all, without requiring developers to adopt a particular style or discipline when programming.

So systems written in Clojure are more reliable, cheaper to maintain and able to solve harder problems.
