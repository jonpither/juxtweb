Clojure (and ClojureScript) advance the state-of-the-art in software development while protecting investment in today's existing computing platforms, such as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the browser.

Rather than offer developers a multitude of language 'features', Clojure reduces the available options to those that will result in _reliable software systems_.

It is a key observation of Clojure's designers that _unreliable software arises from the extent to which a system's internal state changes are allowed to happen_. The result is unmanageable complexity, keeping software development and maintenance costs high and preventing gains from  parallelism.

Clojure reflects a revolution in the way that software developers manage an application's most important asset: it's data. And Clojure's benefits are available to all, without requiring developers to adopt a particular style or discipline when programming.

So systems written in Clojure are more [reliable](#), [cheaper](#) to maintain and solve [harder](#) problems.
